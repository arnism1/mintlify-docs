description: "Blazor is a powerful UI framework for building interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It runs in the browser via WebAssembly or on the server with real-time updates through SignalR. Blazor makes it easy to share code between client and server, and integrates tightly with .NET features like dependency injection, routing, and component-based architecture."

## [Why Blazor?](http://localhost:3003/docs/introduction#why-blazor)

Building modern web apps usually means juggling JavaScript frameworks, APIs, and backend code in different languages. For .NET developers, this can be frustrating and inefficient. Blazor changes that by letting you write full-stack web applications using just C# and .NETâ€”no JavaScript required. You can share code between your frontend and backend, build reusable components, and stay entirely in the .NET ecosystem. Instead of gluing together multiple tools, Blazor gives you a clean, unified approach to building rich, interactive apps.
